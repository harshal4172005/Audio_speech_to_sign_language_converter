# Audio_speech_to_sign_language_converter
The Audio Speech to Sign Language Converter is an assistive tool designed to bridge communication gaps between individuals with hearing impairments and the hearing community. This project converts spoken words (audio input) into corresponding sign language animations or visual representations, making spoken communication more accessible.
